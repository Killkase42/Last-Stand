Range:
Making use of the distance between points on the map, the range mechanic determines how effective the fleet's weapons are. Primary and
secondary weapons and abilities will all have a maximum range assigned to them, beyond which they will not effect the enemy. 


Grid-Based Movement:
In addition to moving around systems with the jump drive, the fleet can be relocated with the use of the grid-movement system. In each
system, a series of points will be available to move to. The enemies will spawn on one far away from the system's forward station,
eventually moving closer (with the goal of capturing the station). This movement mechanic will determine if the fleet is close enough
to the enemy to effectively engage them (range mechanic) and whether it can recapture and repair.

Each ship in the game has its own movement speed (shown in the statistics tab). The fleet's movement speed, how fast they can relocate
from one grid position to another, is determined by finding the average of all three ships' movement speeds in the fleet. Based on this
value, the time it takes to travel from one grid position to another will be modified. This will be done by first finding the
fleet's average speed (80, for example), multiplying it by a constant (0.075, for example), and then dividing the distannce between
grid points (20km, for example), by the answer of the previous calculation (6). This example syntax is represented by the expression
b/(a(0.075)), where a is the fleet's average speed, b is the distance between the points, and 0.075 is the constant. Also, this number
is not truely a constant, as it can be modified by ships' engine boost or slow abilities (returning to normal after the effect wears
off).
