Grid-Based Movement:


Each ship in the game has its own movement speed (shown in the statistics tab). The fleet's movement speed, how fast they can relocate
from one grid position to another, is determined by finding the average of all three ships' movement speeds in the fleet. Based on this
value, the time it takes to travel from one grid position to another will be modified. This will be done by first finding the
fleet's average speed (80, for example), multiplying it by a constant (0.075, for example), and then dividing the distannce between
grid points (20km, for example), by the answer of the previous calculation (6). This example syntax is represented by the expression
b/(a(0.075)), where a is the fleet's average speed, b is the distance between the points, and 0.075 is the constant. Also, this number
is not truely a constant, as it can be modified by ships' engine boost or slow abilities (returning to normal after the effect wears
off).
